Data Visualization and Statistics using Pandas.
In this repository , I have used Pima Indians Diabetes Database as a csv file. This data-set is originally 
from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to 
predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. Several constraints 
were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients 
here are females with at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. It contains following 9 
attributes :-<br />
1.pregs: Number of times pregnant <br />
2.plas: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test <br />
3.pres: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) <br />
4.skin: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) <br />
5.test: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/mL) <br />
6.BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) <br />
7.pedi: Diabetes pedigree function <br />
8.Age: Age (years) <br />
