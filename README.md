Data Visualization and Statistics using Pandas.
In this repository , I have used Pima Indians Diabetes Database as a csv file. This data-set is originally 
from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to 
predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes. Several constraints 
were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients 
here are females with at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. It contains following 9 
attributes.
